# My Project

I got Siri to read out my notes on the computer and recorded Voice Memos of these. These can be downloaded and re-listened to, without having to re-read through my notes again. The content of these notes is also sumarised in word clouds in each subdirectory in this repository 
Here is an example GIF showing the application in action:
